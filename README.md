# Hello!
I'm an artist, programmer, Rust lang enthusiast, and Linux enjoyer.
## I have left GitHub for Codeberg
I have switched to Codeberg for all of my git hosting needs. The repositories that remain on my GitHub profile may eventually fall out-of-date with my Codeberg profile, which will have all the latest versions of every project you see here (and more!).

You can find me on Codeberg at [cosmicmarley17](https://codeberg.org/cosmicmarley17 "cosmicmarley17 on Codeberg.org").

In contrast to GitHub, Codeberg is open source and not controlled by Microsoft.
